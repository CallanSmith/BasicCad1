## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The 2nd assingment was the mount. The mount is a piece very simalair to the base. It has the exact same hole dimensions. The only thing different about it is that its a sqaure instead of a rectangle. The dimensions are 120mmx120mm. It it also 8mm extruded

This was the 2nd CAD assingment we've had, and for me it was the easiest. By following what Mr H. did in class I was was able to figure that you didnt have to create another document to do this part. All you have to do is, sketch a sqaure on top of your base and make sure that the upper left hand corner is connected to the base upper left hand corner. From there make the dimensions 120mm by 120mm and make sure it lines up wiht you base. Use the use featture to select the circles you created for the base. After that, all you have to do is press extrude, and click new. Extrude to 8mm and youll be done.

## Fork

### Description
The fork was the 3rd assingment we had to do for BasicCad. So far this was the hardest because we learned anout filet. The dimensions for this part were complicated, but the basic circle had a diameter of 80mm and was extruded 8 mm. You then make the two Fork parts. To do this you draw a rectangle and through an array of filets and dimensions you have one of the fork parts. After that you just mirror the feature over the plane you want to mirror it over

I thought this was going to be harder than it was. I got a little confused just following the directions, the video by Dr. Shields helped tremendously. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaL7ijtuZI4C2F8Vdg-R4fQ. The hardest part of this assingment was getting the mirror to work. If figured out you have to select the plane parallel to where you want to mirror, to get it to mirror in the correct place.
